# Cute-Little-Virus
this little virus only works to make a new batch everytime for unlimited time, 
echo off making it won't show the virus code that we've typed in. charlie is the 
function, and msg is the body for the message, goto :charlie calls back or execute 
the functions to unlimited times. you can fix this virus just by restarting your pc, 
and it would run back normaly.

the .txt is the code that you can edit
and the .bat is the executable file
remember to save it as .bat to make the virus
